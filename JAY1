A positive attitude brings positive results
You no doubt know the importance a positive attitude plays in your ability to bring positive results (success) into your job, career, and life. And in spite of the negative attitudes you see every day, it’s not a concept that’s somehow been hidden from the emerging workforce.
I’d challenge you, in fact, to find a kid over the age of 8 who hasn’t been lectured to death about the importance of a positive attitude. They get it from their parents, from their teachers, from their coaches, from the clergy, from their scout leaders, and yes, from their employers. The reminders are everywhere they turn.
